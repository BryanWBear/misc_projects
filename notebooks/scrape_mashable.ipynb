       "'Having trouble finding something to watch on Amazon Instant Video? The retailer launched Monday an experimental browsing tool(Opens in a new tab) that lets users discover movies and TV shows based on their genre preferences or simply the mood they\\'re in. Movies and shows are divided up into categories, some of which bear the names of genres (i.e., \"Comedy\" and \"Mystery/Thriller\"), and others which are labeled by mood, such as \"Feel-Good\" and \"Exciting.\" Users can toggle between TV shows and movies, and apply filters to show only videos that are available for free viewing to Prime subscribers, or ones that bear G or PG ratings. It\\'s pretty basic, but it sure beats the haphazard organization of Amazon\\'s current Instant Video(Opens in a new tab) page, which mixes rows of new releases with bestsellers and personal recommendations. The move is the latest in a series of investment\\'s Amazon is making in its streaming video platform. Last week, the company inked a licensing agreement with A+E Networks to bring past seasons of shows from A&E, History, Lifetime and Bio to its streaming library -- shows, it should be noted, that Netflix subscribers lost access to in the fall. Amazon claims its streaming Prime catalog now numbers more than 33,000, double what it was a year ago. '"
